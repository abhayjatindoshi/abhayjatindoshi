### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a simple human, with an OCD of writing clean code ðŸ˜‰ 

We could end up having long conversations ðŸ—£ about backend and frontend, web and mobile, react and angular and the list goes on...

ðŸ¤¥ Get in touch: [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/abhayjatindoshi) or [LinkedIN](https://linkedin.com/in/abhayjatindoshi)

**My good to have stack**
 - `Java`, `Kotlin` with `gradle` scripts for enterprise heavy applications with `psql` or `MySQL` database and `spring` framework.
 - `React` for web-based applications (SPA and PWA)

**Quickly spin apps stack**
- `node.js` for backend with `express.js` framework and `next.js` for serverless applications.
- `Android` with viewmodel and livedata for spinning up mobile applications.

**Favourite technologies**

`IAM` `OpenId` `JS-Promises` `MapReduce` `Java-Streams`
